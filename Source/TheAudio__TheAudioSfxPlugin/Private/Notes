Determine Frequency from MIDI note number: F0 = 2^((F0-69)/12) * 440_hz.

NOTE: 

Our text to speech synthesis strategy includes a builtin articulation tool 
to add expressiveness and variation. The builtin rainbow ribbon will span
the bottom of the waveform, using color to indicate 
vocal dynamics at each sample- with Red for highest emotional intensity 
and Violet for lowest. Pitch and prosity are combined with the tool, for 
ease of use, with additional articulation parameters, for example 
pronunciation selectors for numbers, abbreviations, and polysemuous 
words- such as record/re'cord, for further fine tuning.

NOTE: 

There are two (2) current speech synthesis strategies - 
(1) nlp_parallehiddenmarkov_tts: A parallel wave-shaping strategy around the fundamental frequency, F0; or
(2) nlp_serialhiddenmarkov_tts: A fourty-four state (44) phoneme cascading state-machine with intra-state wave-shaping 
hand-off, for smoother wave-shaping between ingress and egress. (1) is appealing 
for performance reasons, however syncing the shaping parameters may prove difficult;
(2) may be the most straightforawrd to implement, but it may not offer superior performance.

NOTES

what are some operations that can be performed on a pair or multiple pairs of audio signals?


There are many operations that can be performed on pairs or multiple pairs of audio signals, depending on the specific needs of the application. Some common operations include:
1. Mixing: This involves combining two or more audio signals into a single signal. This can be used to combine multiple tracks into a single audio file, or to adjust the balance between different tracks.
2. Summing: This involves adding two or more audio signals together, point by point. This can be used to create a composite signal by adding together multiple tracks or to create a louder overall signal.
3. Crossfading: This involves blending two audio signals together by gradually increasing the volume of one signal while decreasing the volume of the other. This can be used to smooth transitions between tracks or to blend together different sections of a single track.
4. Equalization: This involves adjusting the balance of different frequency bands within an audio signal. This can be used to enhance or alter the overall tonal character of a signal, or to match the frequencies of different tracks.
5. Time stretching: This involves changing the duration of an audio signal without changing its pitch. This can be used to match the tempo of different tracks or to create special effects.
6. Pitch shifting: This involves changing the pitch of an audio signal without changing its duration. This can be used to create harmonies or to transpose a signal to a different musical key.
7. Reverberation: This involves simulating the sound of an audio signal being played in a particular acoustic space, such as a room or a concert hall. This can be used to add depth and ambiance to a signal or to create special effects.


NOTES

how many kinds of reverberation are there?

There are many different types of reverberation that can be used in audio signal processing, ranging from simple algorithms that simulate the reflections in a small room to complex algorithms that simulate the reflections in large spaces such as concert halls or cathedrals. Some common types of reverberation include:

1. Plate reverberation: This is a simple form of reverberation that simulates the reflections in a small room or space. It is achieved by using a delay line to simulate the time it takes for sound to bounce off the walls, and a low-pass filter to simulate the damping of the reflections over time.
2. Spring reverberation: This type of reverberation simulates the reflections in a space using a mechanical spring. It is commonly used in guitar amplifiers to create a sense of space.
3. Convolution reverberation: This type of reverberation involves convolving an audio signal with an impulse response recorded in a particular space. The impulse response captures the reflections and characteristics of the space, and convolving the signal with the impulse response applies those characteristics to the signal.
4. Algorithmic reverberation: This type of reverberation involves using a computer algorithm to simulate the reflections in a particular space. There are many different algorithms that can be used for this purpose, ranging from simple models that simulate the reflections in a small room to complex models that simulate the reflections in large spaces such as concert halls or cathedrals.

In addition to these types of reverberation, there are also many different variations and combinations of these techniques that can be used to achieve a wide range of different sounds and effects.

NOTE: 

Implement spellcheck or branch archive database.corpus.generated.log; 
Add a IPA phonetic tool for phrase customization;
Perform reverse lookup of a misspelled word, based on the miss-spelling's attempted IPA pronounciation.

Add smart (word) suggestions.

Add word tense find and matching (eg singular(cactus), plural(cacti), -e, -y, -ed, -ize, -ized, -ing, -ly)

Add a Share Usage & Statistics option, so crash reports create a new issue page on github

Beware exponential growth (ie The Branching Problem).

Consider implementing a signal deviation/variance parameter-, radius-, or allowed volatility- window,
to smooth the signal transitions between phoneme synthesis modules.

Catalog the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

Implementing tone in speech: Adjectives are noun modifiers which speech can capture in the form of Tone (eg cynical).

Phoneme phrases, separated by hyphens, can be synthesized in parallel.

THE AUDIO

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE 
- icons
- menus
- toolbars
- windows 
- create an Undo buffer 
- patch dual module compilation bug
- Develop connected phoneme or partial phoneme sound synthesis process by noting waveform inflection points
- Map phonemes to word syllable > Map syllables to phrases > Map phrases to words > Map words to clauses > Map clauses to sentences 
- Apply tone to sentences generated . Consider tagging sentences as: affirmative, interrogative or exclamatory sentences. One of the techniques for pitch modification uses discrete cosine transform (DCT) in the source domain (linear prediction residual). Inflection points may be unique identifiers (and synthesis targets) for each phoneme
- CoArticulation is the key to prosody, which is difficult to model in TTS and SSTs. Theory: develop a compact Turing Complete number theoretical fully programmable model that can be to capture the functionality desired . Theory: Analyze synthesis results via Filters (eg. volume of features such as poles measured) can improve vocodec performance 
- Until IPA library is completed, implement the IPA phonetic voice module as a user defined implementation of the required IPA pronunciations along with the option to share the library.
- Musical instruments mimic the frequencies in nature. With software, more nuanced and flexible virtual instruments can be developed.
- Synthesized phoneme waves should connect like perfect penmanship.
- Speech can be decoupled into three independent subtextual components as deliverables : content (information), speaker (information), prosody (information).
- Theory: GPT-3 is a full language compiler equivalent interconnected matrice implemented on the GPU
- Support text-based descriptions to synthesize sound effects on-the-fly

- IIR-, FIR- Filters; Resonance; Comb Filters 
- Mix multi channel Audio files and then normalize 
- Add multi channel Audio files and then normalize from their Fourier transform 
- An audio signal spectrogram shows the 2d inception and duration of constituent frequencies ( resembles piano roll )
- Provide signal assignable oscillators to perform operations on signals
- vibrato, tremolo, echo ( or delay: typically 100s of milliseconds to be perceptible ), convolution reverb, chorus, flanger, phaser, panning 
- Support text-to-speech synthesis & effects; musical note-, and musical instrument synthesis and signal processing . User-tweakable settings 
- Enable Solo channel and or track functionality 

Static Sound Effects 

Ever wonder what sonic fuzz sounds like?  Static sound effects are often made from white, pink, or even brown noise that's then chopped up and subjected to ASDR envelopes. Google that one if you're new to sound synthesis. Check out Interference to add intensity to your sci-fi, fantasy, and horror projects with unmatched gritty and dark sound effects of robotic radio static, scans, morphs, risers and more.

Cartoon Sound Effects 

Cartoon tends to be synonymous with funny when it comes to the sound effects world.  If you need ingredients for a laughter cake, look no farther.  Mmmm. Cake.

Movie Sound Effects 

All the people searching for sounds from famous movies will be thrilled to know that they not only can find and use sounds from Academy-Award winning films, there are thousands to choose from. Check out The Odyssey Collection by Mark Mangini.

Weather Sound Effects 

Brave the elements with sound effects from all weather patterns including wind, rain, thunder, storms, snow & beyond.

Trailer Sound Effects

Video game and movie trailers need big, epic, Hollywood quality sounds to create an impactful impression on the audience. Check out Colossal: Trailer Sound Effects designed by feature film sound editors from Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, Joseph Fraioli and Randy Torres for a collection of high-energy impacts, whooshes, rumbles, and transitions.

Explosion Sound Effects 

One of the most fun sound effects to work with: explosions.  You can build your own with individual elements (wood snap, glass debris, low frequency boom) or use pre-made effects that already contain multiple sound layers. Boooooom.

Vehicle Sound Effects

Whether it's a high-speed chase or a casual Sunday cruise, chances are you'll work on a project where someone is driving, flying, or sailing somewhere. Check out The Odyssey Collection: Vehicles for the most thorough collection of car sound effects available – plus trucks, buses, and motorcycles – curated from the private library of Academy Award®-winners.

Siren Sound Effects 

Build your soundscape and be ready for any chase scene with emergency siren sounds.

Fire Sound Effects

DJs often cross from traditional musical borders into the more abstract sound art territory.  Often spicing mixes up with sound effects, these libraries offer many sounds to choose from. Check out Ember by Richard King for crackling, roaring, and smoldering sound effects.

Gun Sound Effects

Like explosions, gun sound effects are made from multiple elements, and each type of gun sounds drastically different from the next.  Pro Sound Effects customers are often searching for gun sounds. We've got thousands to offer – Check out King Collection: Guns for the most comprehensive collection of gun sounds available.
